# Time Adventure (.Net RPG)

#### By Will Johnson

## Description

Time Adventure was a short two day project, in which we tried to utilize .Net to create an RPG with locations and enemies. The battle logic is ripped and simplified from "'Fun' Fighters", and is not overly complex, but a large portion of the development was spent linking the javascript logic to the .Net framework, as we didn't know how to use AJAX at the time.
